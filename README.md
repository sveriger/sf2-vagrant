Symfony 2 in vagrant vm
=======================

To get this up and running you need to have vagrant installed, see
[Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/). You also need an ubuntu box for vagrant running php 5.3 (e.g. Ubuntu 11.04 Server) named "ubuntu-11.04-server (contact me for one).


Clone the repository and simply run vagrant up ...
